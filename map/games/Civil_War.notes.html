         				<br>
         				<br>The disparity between Union and Confederate strength is offset by their different paths to victory. The United States, fighting for the integrity of the Union, can accept no less than a total conquest of the seceded South, whereas the Confederate States need only to force the Union to negotiate for a <i>modus vivendi</i>.
         				<br>
         				<br><b>Confederate Diplomatic Victory</b> -- Recognition by Britain and France

         				<br>
         				<br><b>Timeline:</b> Each turn represents a month, each full round covers two months. For example, Confederates play January 1862, Union plays February 1862, Confederates then play March 1862, and so on. A notification announcing the month of year appears at the beginning of each player's turn.
         				<br>
                        <br><b>Limited Battle:</b> Rarely were battles in the 19th century battles of complete annihilation. Combat last only two rounds, after which a stalemate is declared if both sides still have troops remaining in the field. The attacker only has one chance to retreat--after the first round of combat. A stalemated territory remains in the ownership of the defender, including all infrastructure within, and continues to generate resources. The defender of a stalemated battlefield then has the option on his turn to:<ul>
						<li>Remain in the territory, initiating a counter-attack whether with or without additional reinforcements.</li>
						<li>Voluntarily withdraw to a friendly territory, giving up the contested territory to the attacker.</li></ul>
                        Abandoned territories are conquered at the end of combat move, so be sure to leave a unit behind to occupy the abandoned territory if you intend to pursue a withdrawing enemy during combat phase.
                        <br>
                        <br><b>Confederate Special Ability:</b> "Forced March."<ul>
						<li>Extra non-combat move before normal combat move resets movement counters.</li></ul>
                        <br><b>Union Special Ability:</b> "Union Logistics."<ul>
						<li>Depots and supply centers give +1 movement to all units, railyards give +1 movement to trains, shipyards give +1 to ships. All units blitz except general, who recieves blitz ability when paired with an elite cavalry, and militia, which does not blitz at all.</li></ul>
                        <br>
         				<br><b>Confederate Turn</b><ul>
						<li>War Financing: may take loans and pay debt.</li>
						<li>First Purchase: may purchase resources in addition to units.</li>
						<li>Non-combat move (Forced March): movement counters reset after this phase</li>
						<li>Second Purchase: may use resources obtained during First Purchase to purchase units</li>
						<li>Place: newly placed units may be immediately used in subsequent phases.</li>
						<li>Combat Move</li>

                        <br><b>Cannonades</b>: This game introduces the idea of cannonades, which represents bombardment from afar. Cannonade mechanics work simililar to aaGuns in that they occur before regular combat and casualties are removed from battle. Note that artillery has both a cannonade ability (shooting shells from afar) and regular attack and defense values (firing grapeshot at close range), meaning artillery units fire in both the cannonade and regular combat sequences.<br>
         				<br>
         				<br><b>Combat Sequence in Detail</b><ul>
						<li>Attacker artillery cannonade (when applicable): Attacker's artillery fires a long-distance bombardment, rolling at 1/12 against each elegible enemy defender. These casualties are removed from battle and do not participate in further combat.</li>
						<li>Defender artillery cannonade (when applicable): Defender's artillery fires a long-distance bombardment, rolling at 1/12 against each elegible enemy attacker. These casualties are removed from battle and do not participate in further combat.</li>
						<li>Defender entrenchment and fortification cannonades (when applicable): Defender's fieldworks fire long-distance bombardments, rolling at 1/12 (for entrenchments) or 2/12 (for fortifications) against each elegible enemy attacker. These casualties are removed from battle and do not participate in further combat.</li>
						<li>Attacker fire: Attacking units close in for combat. These casualties return fire.</li>
						<li>Defender fire: Defending units return close-combat. These casualties are removed from battle.</li>
						<li>End of combat round: At the end of the first combat round, attacker has the choice to retreat or stay for the second round. At the second combat round, stalemate is reached if both sides still have troops remaining.</li>
						</ul>

         				<br>
         				<br>Rivers are a special kind of water territory distinguished from normal sea spaces on the map by a lighter shade of blue coloring. Frigates and battleships cannot navigate river spaces, and pontoon bridges can only be built over rivers.
         				<br>
         				<br>The river forts restrict enemy nagivation of the rivers under normal canal rules. Control of the river forts is a key Union objective; defending them is a Confederate imperative.
         				<br>The following water connections are regulated as canals:
						<br><ul>
						<li>Mississippi River Upper 2 -- Mississippi River Lower 1,
						<br>                controlled by Cairo</li>
						<li>Mississippi River Lower 1 -- Tennesee River Confluence,
						<br>                controlled by Cairo</li>
						<li>Tennesee River Confluence -- Tennesee River Lower,
						<br>                controlled by Fort Henry-Donelson</li>
						<li>Cumberland River Middle -- Cumberland River Lower,
						<br>                controlled by Fort Henry-Donelson</li>
						<li>Mississippi River Lower 2 -- Mississippi River Lower 1,
						<br>                controlled by New Madrid and Columbus Kentucky</li>
						<li>Mississippi River Upper 3 -- Arkansas River Lower,
						<br>                controlled by Fort Hindman</li>
						<li>Mississippi River Lower 4 -- Mississippi River Lower 5,
						<br>                controlled by Vicksburg</li>
						<li>Mississippi River Lower 7 -- Mississippi River Delta,
						<br>                controlled by Fort St Philip and Fort Jackson</li>
						</ul>
         				<br>
         				<br>There are four additional sea connections regulated as canals:
						<br><ul>
						<li>North Carolina Coast SZ -- Albemarle Sound SZ,
						<br>                controlled by Outer Bank North</li>
						<li>North Carolina Coast SZ -- Pamlico Sound SZ,
						<br>                controlled by Outer Bank North and Outer Bank South</li>
						<li>South Carolina Coast SZ -- Pamlico Sound SZ,
						<br>                controlled by Fort Macon and Outher Bank South</li>
						<li>Gulf of Mexico East SZ -- Sargasso Sea SZ,
						<br>                controlled by Key West</li>

                        <br>
                        Railroads are important tools used by both the North and the South for mobilizing for the war effort. Railroad lines are marked on the map as segmented lines connecting the railroad stations, which are separate "sea" territories entirely enclosed by the host territory. Two stations are considered connected if there exists a direct dotted line path between them. Trains <img src="train.png"/> may move between stations only if:<br />
                        <ul><li>You own the two host territories to which the stations belong.</li>
                        <li>You own the territories through which the rail line passes.</li></ul>
                        <br>You must have control of a rail route at the beginning of your turn in order to use it. <br />
                        Loading, moving, and unloading trains work just like transport ships; rail lines work via normal canal rules.<br />
                        <br>Trains are 1/0/2 units and trains trapped in captured stations immediately die when you move your own trains to the captured station.

         				<br>There are five resources in this game:
                        <ul>
						<li><b>Supplies</b>, representing food and equipment,</li>

						<li><b>PUs</b>, representing cash available to the government through taxes and bonds, and </li>
						<li><b>Leadership points</b>, representing battlefield experience and the quality of your officer corps.</li></ul>
                        <br>
						<br>Resources are produced from upgradable infrastructure units located in your territories, not from territory values. Territory values represent the historical population density of the territory, not PU production. Some infrastructure requires a minimum territory value to be placed. <b>Union manpower and training infrastructure can only be built in original Union territory or Pro-Union territory. Confederate manpower and training infrastructure can only be built in original Confederate territory or Pro-Confederate territory.</b> Each territory may contain only one of each of the folloing categories of infrastructure:

                        <br>*Infantry, elite infantry, cavalry, elite cavalry, and engineers charge <b>fuel cost</b> of 1 Supplies per movement point. Artillery, ironclads, and trains charge <b>fuel cost</b> of 1 Industry per movement point. Be careful: Lack of Supplies will make your armies unable to move; lack of Industry will paralyze your rail network. Militia does not require fuel.
                        <br><br>*Movement during <b>winter months</b> (November, December, January, February) will cost twice as much Supplies for infantry, elite infantry, cavalry, elite cavalry, and engineers.
                        <br><br>*Generally speaking, units charge additional Supplies as <b>upkeep</b> regardless of movement at the end of your turn.
                        <br><br>*All <b>field units</b> (that is, all units recruited or upgraded by drill_camp, barracks, parade_ground, or general) charge 1 Manpower upkeep. These units include militia, infantry, cavalry, elite_infantry, elite_cavalry, artillery, and engineers. Because Manpower production per territory is capped at territory value (which represents population density), this means that there are only so many units you can field at any time based on the kinds of territories under your control, and that there is an <b>absolute map maximum of 548 field units</b> that can be present on the map at any time. Comparing these numbers to historical data, we can conclude that each field unit roughly represents two thousand men.<br>

<br>*Submarines, torpedoes, and transports do not block movement.<br>
<br>*Torpedoes are naval mines, special defensive units that fire once before a battle and cannot be taken as casualties. Each torpedo rolls at 3 at one ship. To target more ships you need more torpedoes. Torpedo fields are either cleared after combat, or in the case of empty torpedo fields devoid of enemy units, cleared at the beginning of enemy combat move phase.<br>

         				<br>
                        During the Civil War, both the Confederate and Union governments accrued significant amounts of government debt in order to finance the war. In this game during the War Financing phase, players may choose to take out 2-year (12-round) loans of $200 each, at variable interest compounded (see below), and pay back past debt commitments. Players may only take out one loan per turn.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Players each have <b>3 loan "slots"</b> and therefore can only have a total of 3 active loans at any one time. Loans are lump sums of cash (PUs) given to the player as soon as a player takes out a loan, and are repaid as principal plus interest in flat bimonthly installments every subsequent round. If a player skips a payment or is unable to pay these debt commitments, then the interest rate on all of the player's debt and on any future loans is increased by 5% and owes backpay the subsequent round. If a player fails to pay for two rounds in a row, the player defaults on their loans, which is very, very bad.
                        <br>
                        <br>For example:<ul>
                        <li>You take out a loan for $200 at 25% compounded interest. Congratulations, you suddenly have $200.</li>
                        <li>Starting the subsequent round for 12 rounds, your payment each round will be $27, for a total of $324 you will have paid by the time you finish repaying your loan.</li>
                        <li>If you miss a payment, all of your interest rates increase to 30% and the prices of your monthly payments are adjusted.</li>
                        <li>The next round, you will have to pay $30 (the new price) for the backpay you missed AND another $30 for the payment owed that round.</li>
                        <li>If you miss your payment again, you default on your loans.</li>
                        <li>There are no interest rates available above 50%. If you miss a payment priced at 50%, you default as well.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>When a player default on their loans:<ul>
                        <li>All resource stockpiles are set to 0</li>
                        <li>All combat and command/logistic units except militia and torpedo are removed from the map.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>If you still have loan slots left, you can of course take out new loans to finance your old debt, but that's a pyramid scheme and not sustainable long-term. The chart below explains the payment prices for loans in detail.

         				<br>
The Union blockade had a profound effect on the Southern economy, choking off cotton exports and driving inflation to runaway levels. In this game, there are 12 blockade zones marked with the blockade icon, as well as 12 blockade ports, marked with the anchor icon. Blockade efficiency is measured in increments of 10% from 0-100%, and calculated as follows:
<br><ul>
<li>Naval patrols: 10% for each Union frigate in the weakest-blockaded zone, up to 4 frigates.</li>
<li>Port capture: 10% for every 2 blockade ports captured by Union ground forces.</li>
</ul>
<br>Note that the efficiency of Union naval patrols is only as good as its weakest patrol. If you have 3 frigates in each of 11 blockade zones, but only 1 in the 12th, your ships still only contribute 10% blockade efficiency. Also note that naval patrols can only contribute up to 40% blockade efficiency--In other words, having 5 or 6 or 10 frigates per blockade zone still brings in only 40%. If you want to push blockade efficiency higher, you must capture the ports themselves.
         				<br>
         				<br>The Union blockade will cause inflation and reduce industrial and supply production (see chart below)
